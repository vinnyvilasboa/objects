//====boolean expressions & logical operators====//

!(5==="5") && (6 > 5) && (1 >= 0)

//not equals -> true && 6 is less than 5 && 1 is bigger or equals to 0 --> i would say this is true because the only one that would not have been true was the first one.. my only question is when will i use this. 

//write code that sets a placeholder variable and sets food as variable and vegetables as its value.
//set conditionals for boolean value based on if/else statements
//print value based on isTasty
let isTasty;

let food ="vegetables";

if(food === "pizza"){
    isTasty = true;
    //sets a boolean value to the empty placeholder
}else {
    isTasty = false;
}

console.log("is the food tasty?", isTasty);
